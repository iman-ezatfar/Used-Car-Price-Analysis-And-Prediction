# Used-Car-Price-Analysis-And-Prediction

This project builds predictive models to estimate used car prices based on various vehicle attributes. The workflow includes:

Data Collection & Cleaning: 
  - Imported a raw used car dataset, handled missing values by imputation and removal, and corrected data types.

Feature Engineering:
  - Standardized and normalized numerical features; created categorical dummy variables; applied binning to horsepower.

Exploratory Data Processing:
  - Converted fuel consumption metrics to liters per 100 km for better interpretability.

Modeling: 
  - Trained and evaluated multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Hyperparameter Tuning:
  - Optimized XGBoost parameters to improve prediction accuracy.

Evaluation:
  - Compared model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics, selecting the best model based on predictive power.

This end-to-end pipeline demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using Python and popular ML libraries.
